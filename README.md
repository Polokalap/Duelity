# What is Duelity

Duelity is a Duel plugin for Minecraft paper servers that lets people well... duel!
I have made many duel plugins before, and they were all messy and most importantly, private.
Many of my friends asked me to make them a custom one, but it would've taken too long and I would have got nothing in return, so there isn't much reason for me to do it.
In December 2025, my friend told me about [HackClub Carnival](https://carnival.hackclub.com/), and I felt like I could do this, because so many people requested it and I would get some sort of reward here.
The name came from the CS:2 skin, Duality because I was trying to think of a name and gave it this temporarily and didn't bother to change it.

## Here's a video featuring the plugin:
